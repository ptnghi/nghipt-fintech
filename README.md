# Overview of FinTech 
## I. What is fintech from different perspectives.
According to Investopia: “Financial technology (Fintech) is used to describe new tech that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services.” However what it actually is depends on who you ask and who is dealing with it. 

For giant traditional firms or so called dinosaur, fintech has been around for years. Back in the old days, firms used big main frame computer and typewriters, telephone to do their service. While it is the state of the art at the time, it is nothing compared to today’s digital power. However it does not mean that those method were inefficient. In fact people were able to do billions of dollars transactions with those kind of technology. It is rudimentary yes but it is technology nonetheless and in one way or another improving firms service. Nowadays, with new technologies, companies are able to do transactions at a speed far greater and with much higher volumne than before. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba, WePay have revolutionize the whole system. Now it becomes a system where it all depends on data. How can companies make money out of data and and analyzing that data at the same time. However using data comes with a whole set of different risk. So the question now is will old giant firms survive and devour the newcomers or they will succumb under the pressure of new techonology and die?

For individual investor, Fintech provides a new product to their portfolio. Nowadays it’s not rare to see people talking about investing in cryptocurrency or do crypto-trading. For these young investors, growing up in the computer digital era, it is something more familiar to them than say stocks or bonds. With how fast it is moving, the boom and bust of the crypto market is much more profound on more visible however that is just the nature of the market itself. We’ve seen crisis and busts of other market as well so saying that the crypto market is more unstable is not quite right. It is just faster and because it is faster people can make money out of it faster. With all that said, investors should be careful and understand the market before jumping in as well as consider the crypto as a holding property like gold.

For consumers, we love FinTech. People love convenience and FinTech gives them just that. They love it so much that nowadays millenials even trust tech company like Amazon, Alibaba more than traditional banking. They’d rather buy stuff and do online transactions through the website than going to a bank.
II. Implication and Trend of Fintech

## Why FinTech is a threat to banking?

FinTech is developing rapidly and people are prefering it over traditional bank. In China, where FinTech adoption rate is 60%, people are using Alipay, Wepay more than traditional bank. And they’re not going back. There’s no way they’re going to give up the convenience they already had to go back to traditional banking. In the West, where people are more familiar with banking, it is less of a threat but it has changed banking as a whole. Banks have to be good at data analytic or have to be part of a group served by a firm that is good at analytic. Those who don’t will fail. But when FinTech moves to fast, it becomes a threat if the banks can’t respond. It is a threat because once you lose a customer, you can’t get them back. Furthermore, unlike 10 or 15 years ago where bank are dominant financial force with massive capital, tech companies today have the same if not more capabilites than large banks, overcoming them through sheer capital strength isn’t going to work anymore. Banks are no longer the stronger side, the battle to win back customer now become an uphill battle. Just like what Amazon did to Walmart, FinTech is going to do the same to banking.

### Global trend of FinTech

The first trend is FinTech startup boom. There is a huge interest in FinTech right now with large amount of money being put in startups and a great amount of startups rising by the day. This trend leads to the next trend: Merges and Acquisitions.
In recent years, there are about 200 deals per year in this market and this number is only increasing along with deal’s value. However primary buyers are tech companies, not banks. That is there are more deals within the FinTech space or the tech space in general. Some FinTech firms even buy small, regional or community banks. They also collaborate with each other, banks can outsource part of their job outside or tech companies can outsource their product.
The third trend is cryptocurrency. The number of cryptocurrencies is now in the hundreds. This create an interesting trend of ICOs replacing IPOs as a way of raising money. Many companies used this method to to avoid regulations tied with IPOs. This certainly alarmed regulators and policy makers, requiring new policies to catch up with these trends.

## III. Technology behind Fintech

### Identity, Privacy and Anonymity

Just like in physical world, we sometimes want to indentify ourselves in the digital world. However we also want to be able to do so without givng away too much information. While this can be good for the customer it is bad for the companies because high privacy means harder data ming and analytics. Traditionally, we used to identify ourselves by signatures but that is not really secured now as fraud become more common. People can easily copy or forge a signature. Password are a bit more secure but as you know once the password is leaked, you’re done. Biometrics feel much more secure but there can be ways around that as well. For example a kid may used his mother fingerprint while she asleep to unlock her phone and buy stuff on Amazon. Not saying that it’s bad, it just mean that biometric is not perfect. In conclusion, identity is important for FinTech and it is up to the developers to find a balance between methods to yield the best security and usability.

### Blockchain and Encryption

We often hear about Blockchain but not Distributed Ledgers(DLT). Distributed ledgers is simply a consensus of replicated, shared and synchronized digital data that is spread geographically. Blockchain is a demonstration of the DLT concept and Bitcoin is just an application of it. Encryption is crucial in FinTech while DLT can open up many ways of doing business.
